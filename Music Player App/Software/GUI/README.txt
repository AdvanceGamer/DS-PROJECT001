       MusicPlayer(GUI) - User Manual
======================================

-------------------
**Introduction**
-------------------
The *MusicPlayer(GUI)* application is a Java-based music player with a graphical user interface (GUI). 
It is built using Java Swing, and this manual will guide you through running the application.

--------------------
**File Structure**
--------------------
Example directory structure:

    /MusicPlayerGUI
    │
    ├── MusicPlayer(GUI).jar     # The main executable JAR file.
    └── README.txt               # This manual.

-----------------------------------
**Running the Application**
-----------------------------------

### **Windows/Linux/macOS**: 

1. **Prerequisites**:
    --> Make sure you have **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** installed on your system.
    --> Verify Java is installed by running the following command in the Command Prompt/Terminal:
    ```
    java --version
    ```
    
    If Java is not installed, download and install it from the official website:
    - [Download Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

2. **How to Run the Application**:

    - **Step 1**: Locate the `MusicPlayer(GUI).jar` file in your file explorer.
    - **Step 2**: Double-click on the `MusicPlayer(GUI).jar` file. This will launch the application.

    **Note**: The application should run directly when double-clicked because it uses Java Swing for the graphical interface. No additional scripts are needed.

-------------------------------------------------
**Troubleshooting (If the Application Doesn't Run)**
-------------------------------------------------

If the application does not run after double-clicking the JAR file, follow these steps:

1. **Check Java Installation**:
    Ensure that Java is properly installed by running:
    ```
    java --version
    ```
    
2. **Run via Command Line**:
    If double-clicking doesn't work, try running the JAR from the command line:

    **For Windows**:
    1. Open the **Command Prompt**.
    2. Navigate to the folder containing `MusicPlayer(GUI).jar` using the `cd` command.
    3. Run the following command:
    ```
    java -jar MusicPlayer(GUI).jar
    ```

    **For Linux/macOS**:
    1. Open the **Terminal**.
    2. Navigate to the folder containing `MusicPlayer(GUI).jar` using the `cd` command.
    3. Run the following command:
    ```
    java -jar MusicPlayer(GUI).jar
    ```
